	abstract = {Procedures for computing content validity ( V) and consistency re liability ( R) coefficients and determining the statistical significance of these coefficients are described. These procedures, which employ the multinomial probability distribution for small samples and nor mal curve probability estimates for large samples, can be used in a variety of situations where judgments of the content validity of items or questionnaires are made on ordinal rating scales. Computing for mulas for determining the statistical significance of V and R for large samples of raters and any number of rating categories are given. A computer program has been written to determine the right- tail probabilities associated with values of V and R obtained from ratings by N raters using c rating categories.},

	abstract = {This study aims to describe the development, feasibility, and practicality of PBL-based sound wave interactive multimedia using Lumi. The research method used is research and development. The model used is an Instructional Design type ADDIE which consists of 5 stages namely Analyze, Design, Development, Implementation, and Evaluate. The results showed that PBL-based sound wave interactive multimedia using Lumi was declared feasible by the validator with an average Aiken validity index of 0.86 (very high). The teacher as a practitioner states that practical interactive multimedia is used in learning physics with an average value of 93.30 (very practical). Students also stated that practical interactive multimedia was used in learning physics with an average value of 90.46 (very practical). Based on the results of the study, it can be concluded that PBL-based interactive multimedia using Lumi is declared feasible and practical for use in the physics learning process, especially in sound wave material.},

	doi = {10.1177/0013164485451012},
	abstract = {Three numerical coefficients (V, R, and H) for analyzing the validity and reliability of ratings are described. Each coefficient, which ranges in value from 0 to 1, is computed as the ratio of an obtained to a maximum sum of differences in ratings, or as 1 minus that ratio. Computer programs for calculating the coefficients, their associated individual and cumulative right-tail probabilities, and the population mean and standard deviation of each coefficient are available. Tables of the individual and right-tail probabilities for selected values of the three coefficients are included for 2 to 7 rating categories and 2 to 25 items or raters. More complete probability tables can be generated for any value of c, m, or n with one of the computer programs provided. When the number of items or raters is large ({\textgreater}25), the right-tail probability associated with any value of a coefficient may be estimated by a z-score procedure. The three coefficients are applicable not only to validity and reliability (test-retest and internal consistency) determinations but also to the item analysis, agreement analysis, and cluster or factor analysis of rating-scale data.},
